This PR bootstraps the MyXen monorepo with an initial scaffold to accelerate development.

Included:
- Monorepo top-level structure and service directories (/services, /mobile, /infra, /docs)
- OpenAPI bundle and locker service OpenAPI skeleton (/services/locker-service/openapi/myxen_locker_openapi.json)
- Laravel starter for locker-service:
  - routes/api.php (auth + locks endpoints)
  - Controllers: AuthController.php, LockController.php (skeleton)
  - Service: SolanaService.php (interface)
  - Example migration: create_locks_table
  - Models: User.php, Lock.php (basic)
- docker-compose.yml for local development (app, db, redis, solana-service)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (ci.yml) to run PHP composer install, phpunit and static checks
- .env.example with required environment variable placeholders
- README.md (top-level) updated with overview and next steps

Why:
- Provides a reproducible local dev environment
- Adds the OpenAPI for locker so teams can generate stubs
- Minimal, secure-by-default starter code for immediate integration with solana microservice

How to test:
1. Checkout branch locally
2. `docker compose up -d`
3. `docker compose exec app composer install`
4. `php artisan migrate`
5. Run `php artisan test` and ensure basic tests pass

Notes:
- No private keys or secrets included — uses placeholders and expects KMS for production keys.
- Solana signature verification is stubbed in SolanaService and should be implemented by the solana-service or using an audited php library.

Please review the files below. I can open follow-up PRs to scaffold further services (auth, treasury, payments) once this lands.
